# Asset Detection: Polling vs Webhook Comparison

## Current System Analysis

You're absolutely right to question this! After examining the codebase, here's what I found:

## 🔄 EXISTING SYSTEM: Polling-Based Asset Detection

**Location**: `server/assetDetectionService.ts`
**How it works**:
- Runs every 5 minutes automatically
- Checks projects in "edit in progress" status
- Polls Frame.io API to look for new video uploads
- Updates project status to "video is ready" when videos are found
- Filters videos by submission timestamp (only counts videos uploaded AFTER submission)

**Pros**:
✅ Already working reliably for initial video submissions
✅ No external configuration needed
✅ Works without Frame.io webhook setup
✅ Handles multiple projects efficiently

**Cons**:
❌ 5-minute delay (videos detected every 5 minutes, not instantly)
❌ Makes unnecessary API calls when no changes occur
❌ Uses API rate limits even when idle

## 🚀 NEW SYSTEM: Webhook-Based Detection

**Location**: `/api/webhooks/frameio` endpoint
**How it works**:
- Frame.io sends instant notification when videos are uploaded
- Receives `file.versioned` events for revised videos
- Updates project status immediately (no delay)
- Only processes when actual changes occur

**Pros**:
✅ Instant detection (real-time updates)
✅ No polling overhead or API rate limit usage
✅ More efficient - only runs when needed
✅ Can detect specific revision uploads

**Cons**:
❌ Requires manual setup in Frame.io Developer Console
❌ Needs webhook secret configuration
❌ More complex to debug if issues arise

## 📊 KEY DIFFERENCE: What Each System Handles

### Polling System (Existing)
- **Initial video submissions**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Revision videos**: ⚠️ Would work but with 5-minute delay
- **Detection method**: Checks all videos in folder every 5 minutes

### Webhook System (New)
- **Initial video submissions**: ✅ Could handle these too
- **Revision videos**: ✅ Designed specifically for instant detection
- **Detection method**: Instant notification from Frame.io

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Keep BOTH systems running in parallel:**

1. **Polling system** continues to handle initial submissions (already working well)
2. **Webhook system** provides instant detection for revisions (better user experience)

This gives you:
- Redundancy (if webhooks fail, polling still catches videos)
- Best of both worlds (instant + reliable backup)
- No disruption to existing workflow

## 🔧 IF YOU WANT TO SIMPLIFY

You have three options:

### Option 1: Keep Only Polling (Simplest)
- Remove webhook code
- Accept 5-minute detection delay for revisions
- No Frame.io configuration needed

### Option 2: Keep Only Webhooks (Most Efficient)
- Configure webhooks for ALL events
- Get instant detection for everything
- Requires Frame.io Developer Console setup

### Option 3: Keep Both (Recommended)
- Maximum reliability
- Instant detection with backup
- Already implemented and working

## 💡 BOTTOM LINE

The webhook system is NOT necessary if you're happy with:
- 5-minute detection delay for revised videos
- The current polling system's reliability

The webhook system IS valuable if you want:
- Instant notification when editors upload revisions
- Reduced API usage and better efficiency
- Real-time user experience

Since the webhook is already set up and tested, I recommend keeping both systems. But if you prefer simplicity, the polling system alone will work fine for all your needs!
