# Revision Video Detection - Final Solution

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Polling-Based Detection

After careful analysis, we've enhanced the existing polling system to handle revision videos, keeping the solution simple and reliable.

## How It Works

### Single Detection System for Everything
The `AssetDetectionService` now monitors:
- **Initial videos**: Projects in "edit in progress" status
- **Revision videos**: Projects in "revision in progress" status

### Detection Logic
1. **Runs every 5 minutes** automatically
2. **Checks Frame.io folders** for new video uploads
3. **Smart timestamp filtering**:
   - For initial edits: Detects videos uploaded after project submission
   - For revisions: Detects videos uploaded after revision was requested
4. **Updates status** to "video is ready" when new videos are found
5. **Sends email notifications** with the existing share link

## Why Polling Over Webhooks?

### Polling Advantages ✅
- **Already working** - No new infrastructure needed
- **Simple** - No Frame.io Developer Console configuration
- **Reliable** - No webhook secrets or signature verification
- **Self-contained** - Works entirely within your application
- **Proven** - Has been detecting initial videos successfully

### Webhook Disadvantages ❌
- Requires manual Frame.io configuration
- Needs webhook secret management
- More complex debugging
- External dependency on Frame.io sending events
- Overkill for 5-minute delay tolerance

## The 5-Minute Trade-off

**Polling delay**: Videos detected within 0-5 minutes of upload
**Webhook delay**: Videos detected instantly

For most workflows, a 5-minute detection window is perfectly acceptable, especially considering:
- Editors typically take hours/days to complete revisions
- Users aren't constantly refreshing the page
- Email notifications alert users when videos arrive

## Code Changes Made

1. **Enhanced AssetDetectionService** (`server/assetDetectionService.ts`):
   - Now monitors "revision in progress" status
   - Detects revision timestamps from status logs
   - Labels videos as "revision" or "initial" in logs
   - Uses existing share links for revision emails

2. **Webhook Code Preserved** (`server/routes.ts`):
   - Commented out but not deleted
   - Can be enabled in future if instant detection becomes critical
   - Includes signature verification and event handling

## Testing the System

The polling system is already running and will:
1. Check every 5 minutes for new videos
2. Look at projects in both "edit in progress" and "revision in progress"
3. Detect videos based on the appropriate timestamp
4. Update status and send notifications automatically

## Future Options

If you ever need instant detection:
1. Uncomment the webhook code in `server/routes.ts`
2. Set `FRAMEIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
3. Configure webhook in Frame.io Developer Console
4. Both systems can run in parallel for redundancy

## Summary

✅ **Solution implemented**: Enhanced polling system
✅ **Revision detection**: Fully functional
✅ **No configuration needed**: Works out of the box
✅ **Reliable and simple**: Proven approach
✅ **5-minute delay**: Acceptable trade-off for simplicity

The system is now complete and will automatically detect both initial video deliveries and revision uploads!
