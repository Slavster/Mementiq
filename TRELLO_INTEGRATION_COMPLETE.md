# Trello Integration Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive Trello integration for Mementiq's project workflow automation. The system automatically creates and manages Trello cards throughout the entire project lifecycle, from initial submission to completion and revisions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Trello Service (`server/services/trello.ts`)
- **Board Management**: Get user's Trello boards
- **List Management**: Get lists within boards
- **Card Operations**: Create, update, and move cards
- **Comment System**: Add comments to cards for status updates
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging

### 2. Automation Service (`server/services/trello-automation.ts`)
- **Configuration Management**: Set up and manage board/list mappings
- **Project Card Creation**: Auto-create cards when projects are submitted to editors
- **Completion Tracking**: Move cards to "Done" when videos are delivered
- **Revision Management**: Create revision cards with editor inheritance
- **Metadata Storage**: Embed project details in card descriptions

### 3. Database Schema Extensions
- **`trello_cards` table**: Maps projects to Trello cards with tracking info
- **`trello_config` table**: Stores board and list configuration

### 4. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/trello/boards` - Get user's Trello boards
- `GET /api/trello/boards/:boardId/lists` - Get board lists
- `POST /api/trello/config` - Setup Trello configuration
- `GET /api/trello/config` - Get current configuration
- `POST /api/trello/test` - Test integration with sample card

### 5. Workflow Integration Points
- **Project Submission**: Creates initial project card when status changes to "edit in progress"
- **Video Delivery**: Moves cards to "Done" when videos are ready (via asset detection)
- **Revision Payment**: Creates revision cards after successful payment
- **Revision Completion**: Marks revision cards as complete

## Architecture Decisions

### One-Way Communication
- App → Trello only (no webhooks)
- Stays within Trello free plan limits
- Avoids webhook complexity and reliability issues
- Maintains data integrity with database as source of truth

### Metadata Storage Strategy
- Uses card descriptions for metadata (custom fields not available on free plan)
- Embeds structured data: project ID, client info, Frame.io links, revision count
- Maintains editor assignments across revisions
- Includes subscription tier information

### Editor Assignment Inheritance
- Revision cards inherit editor assignments from original project cards
- Supports consistent team member assignments
- Tracks revision history and editor workload

## Setup Process

### 1. Get Trello API Credentials
1. Visit https://trello.com/app-key
2. Get your API Key (set as `TRELLO_API_KEY`)
3. Generate a Token (set as `TRELLO_TOKEN`)

### 2. Configure Board Setup
1. Call `GET /api/trello/boards` to see available boards
2. Call `GET /api/trello/boards/:boardId/lists` to see board lists
3. Call `POST /api/trello/config` with:
   ```json
   {
     "boardId": "board_id_here",
     "todoListId": "todo_list_id", 
     "doneListId": "done_list_id",
     "revisionListId": "revision_list_id" // optional
   }
   ```

### 3. Test Integration
- Call `POST /api/trello/test` to create a test card
- Or run `node test_trello_integration.js` for comprehensive testing

## Card Content Examples

## Error Handling

### API Credential Issues
- Clear error messages for missing/invalid credentials
- Graceful fallback when Trello operations fail
- Project workflow continues even if Trello integration fails

### Configuration Validation
- Validates board and list IDs before saving
- Checks list belongs to specified board
- Provides helpful error messages for setup issues

### Network and Rate Limits
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Respects Trello API rate limits
- Logs all operations for debugging

## Benefits

### For Project Management
- **Complete Visibility**: All projects visible in Trello board
- **Status Tracking**: Automatic status updates without manual intervention
- **Team Coordination**: Clear assignment and workload distribution
- **Client Context**: All client and project info in one place

### For Workflow Efficiency
- **Automated Card Creation**: No manual card creation needed
- **Consistent Information**: Standardized card format with all necessary details
- **Revision Tracking**: Clear linkage between original and revision work
- **Timeline Visibility**: Chronological view of project progression

### For Compliance & Auditing
- **Complete History**: Full audit trail of project lifecycle
- **Client Information**: All client details attached to work items
- **Subscription Tracking**: Visibility into client subscription tiers
- **Editor Accountability**: Clear assignment and completion tracking

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing
1. Submit a new project → Verify card created in todo list
2. Complete video upload → Verify card moved to done list
3. Request revision → Verify revision card created
4. Complete revision → Verify revision card marked done

### API Testing
- Use `test_trello_integration.js` for comprehensive testing
- Test all endpoints with authentication
- Validate configuration setup process
- Verify error handling scenarios

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logs to Monitor
- Card creation success/failure
- API credential validation
- Configuration changes
- Error rates and types

### Periodic Maintenance
- Monitor Trello API usage against free plan limits
- Review card creation patterns for optimization
- Validate configuration remains valid
- Check for API credential expiration

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

### Scalability Considerations
- **Multiple Boards**: Support different boards for different project types
- **Advanced Filtering**: Create specialized lists for different subscription tiers
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple simultaneous projects
- **API Optimization**: Batch operations to reduce API calls

This Trello integration provides a robust, automated project management solution that bridges the gap between Mementiq's internal workflow and external team coordination tools.
