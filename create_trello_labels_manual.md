# Manual Trello Label Creation Guide

Since the Trello API is having issues with creating labels programmatically, please create the subscription tier labels manually:

## Steps to Create Labels in Trello:

1. **Open your Trello board**: Go to https://trello.com/b/kg3EFU40 (Editing Projects Board)

2. **Access Board Menu**: 
   - Click the "..." menu in the top-right of your board
   - Select "Labels"

3. **Create the following subscription tier labels**:

   **Growth Accelerator**
   - Name: `Growth Accelerator`  
   - Color: Red
   - Description: Premium tier - 48 hour turnaround

   **Consistency Club**
   - Name: `Consistency Club`
   - Color: Orange  
   - Description: Standard tier - 4 day turnaround

   **Creative Spark**
   - Name: `Creative Spark`
   - Color: Yellow
   - Description: Basic tier - 7 day turnaround

4. **Save the labels**: Click "Create Label" for each one

## Once Labels Are Created:

The system will automatically:
- Detect existing labels by name when creating cards
- Apply the correct subscription tier label to new project cards
- Use the labels for visual organization and filtering
- Keep existing workflow labels (Paying Client, Trial Client, etc.) alongside new subscription labels

## Benefits:

- **Visual Priority**: Red (Growth Accelerator) = Highest priority, Yellow (Creative Spark) = Standard priority
- **Easy Filtering**: Click any label to filter cards by subscription tier
- **Clean Cards**: Subscription info moved from card descriptions to labels
- **Workflow Integration**: Labels applied automatically when projects are submitted to editors

The enhanced Trello integration is ready and will work as soon as these labels exist on your board!
