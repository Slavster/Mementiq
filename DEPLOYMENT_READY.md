# Deployment Configuration Complete

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Missing 'start' script**: Created `start.js` file that serves as the production start command
✅ **Missing build command**: Created `custom-build.sh` executable script for build process  
✅ **Build script executable**: Made `custom-build.sh` executable with proper permissions
✅ **Production-ready commands**: Updated deployment scripts to handle production environment

## Deployment Files

### Build Process
- `custom-build.sh` - Main build script (executable)
- `deployment-build.cjs` - Deployment build logic (renamed to .cjs for CommonJS compatibility)

### Start Process  
- `start.js` - Production start script (executable)
- `dist/server.js` - Built production server entry point

## How It Works

### Build Command
```bash
bash custom-build.sh
```
This runs the deployment build process which:
1. Cleans previous builds (`rm -rf dist`)
2. Builds client assets with Vite (`npx vite build --mode production`)  
3. Creates production server entry point in `dist/server.js`

### Run Command
```bash
node start.js
```
This starts the production server which:
1. Checks for built assets in `dist/server.js`
2. If found, runs the built server
3. If not found, falls back to running server directly with tsx

## Build Output
- **Client assets**: `dist/public/` (static files, CSS, JS bundles)
- **Server entry**: `dist/server.js` (production server startup script)

## Production Environment
The server automatically:
- Sets NODE_ENV to "production"
- Handles graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Provides error handling and process monitoring
- Falls back to direct server execution if builds are missing

## Ready for Deployment
All deployment requirements have been satisfied:
- ✅ Build command exists and works
- ✅ Start command exists and works
- ✅ Scripts are executable
- ✅ Production environment configured
- ✅ Build artifacts generated successfully

The application is now ready for deployment on Replit.
