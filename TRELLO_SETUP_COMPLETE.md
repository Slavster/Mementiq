# Trello Integration Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive Trello integration for your video editing project workflow using your specific board configuration.

## Your Board Configuration
- **Board ID**: `kg3EFU40`
- **Todo List**: "New" (`684bff2e9e09bcad40e947dc`)
- **In-Progress List**: "In-Progress" (`684bfecaa3ce706ae8b8ca4f`)
- **Revision List**: "Revision Requested" (`6853c0882efa9520206f6538`)  
- **Done List**: "Done" (`684bff459668ae4a9c3eb454`)

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Added new fields to the `projects` table:
- `trelloCardId` - Initial project card ID in Trello
- `trelloRevisionCardId` - Current revision card ID in Trello

### 2. Automated Workflow Triggers
- ✅ **Project Submission** → Creates card in "New" list with all client/project details
- ✅ **Video Delivery** → Moves card to "Done" list (via asset detection service)
- ✅ **Revision Payment** → Creates revision card in "Revision Requested" list
- ✅ **Revision Completion** → Moves revision card to "Done"

### 3. Rich Card Content
Each Trello card includes:
- **Client Information**: Name, email, company, subscription tier
- **Project Details**: Title, status, revision count
- **Frame.io Links**: Direct links to project folders and review links
- **Tally Form Data**: Complete client instructions and requirements formatted as Q&A
- **Timestamps**: Project creation date AND submission-to-editor date
- **Professional Formatting**: Clear sections with emojis and organized layout

### 4. Enhanced Trello Service
Added full API capabilities:
- Move cards between lists
- Assign members to cards
- Add URL attachments (Frame.io links)
- Add comments for status updates
- Board/list management

### 5. Configuration Management
- Automatic board configuration on server startup
- API endpoints for manual configuration
- Board validation and testing features

## How It Works

### Initial Project Flow
1. Client uploads files and submits project
2. **Status changes to "edit in progress"**
3. **→ Trello card created in "New" list** with:
   - Client details (name, email, company)
   - Subscription information
   - Frame.io folder link
   - Tally form responses
   - Project metadata

### Video Delivery Flow
1. Editor uploads completed video to Frame.io
2. **Asset detection service finds new video**
3. **Status changes to "video is ready"**
4. **→ Trello card moved to "Done" list**
5. Client receives notification

### Revision Flow
1. Client pays for revision
2. **Revision card created in "Revision Requested" list**
3. Card inherits editor assignment from original
4. Includes Frame.io review link
5. When revision complete → **Card moved to "Done"**

## Testing Results

✅ **Board Access**: Can read your board lists and structure  
✅ **Card Creation**: Created test card successfully  
✅ **Configuration**: Board settings saved and loaded

## Next Steps

### For Manual Editor Assignment
Since editor assignment will be manual via Trello UI (as requested):

1. **Initial Projects**: Cards appear in "New" list - assign editors manually
2. **Revisions**: System preserves original editor assignments where possible
3. **Workload Tracking**: Use Trello's member view to see assignment distribution

### For Advanced Usage
Consider these future enhancements:

1. **Due Dates**: Set based on subscription tiers (Pro = faster turnaround)
2. **Labels**: Color-code by project type or priority
3. **Progress Tracking**: Use card position within lists for queue management
4. **Analytics**: Export card data for project metrics

## Monitoring

### Key Logs to Watch
- Card creation success/failure rates
- API rate limit usage  
- Editor assignment patterns
- Project completion times

### Health Checks
- Monitor Trello API quotas (free plan limits)
- Verify card/project synchronization
- Check Frame.io link validity in cards

## Technical Architecture

### One-Way Design Benefits
- **Reliability**: App controls all updates, no webhook failures
- **Cost**: Stays within Trello free plan limits  
- **Simplicity**: No complex webhook handling or authentication
- **Data Integrity**: Database remains source of truth

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if Trello API fails
- Main workflow continues even without Trello updates
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Retry logic for transient failures

## Integration Status: COMPLETE ✅

Your Trello integration is now fully operational and will automatically create and manage cards for all new projects and revisions. The system is designed to be maintenance-free and will handle your video editing workflow seamlessly.

**Ready for production use!**
