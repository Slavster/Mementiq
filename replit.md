- **Frontend Path Update**: Updated portfolio component URLs from `/Objects/Thumbnails/` to `/Thumbnails/` to match actual Object Storage structure
- **Result**: API now serving full file content (3.6MB thumbnails, 25MB videos) via `/api/assets/*` endpoints

### File Structure (Final Working):
- Frontend URLs: `/api/assets/Thumbnails/`, `/api/assets/Videos/` (direct paths matching Object Storage)
- Actual Storage: `Thumbnails/`, `Videos/` (root level directories in Object Storage)
- Files: `tu_lan_cover.jpg`, `Coaching Ad Cover.png`, `conference cover.png`, `Swap_in_city_cover.png`, `Sun a wear cover.png`, `Travel video.mp4`, etc.
- **Technical Detail**: Object Storage SDK `downloadAsBytes()` returns `{ok: true, value: [Buffer]}` where Buffer contains actual file data

### Performance Optimizations (July 10, 2025):
- **Memory Caching**: Thumbnails cached in-memory for 10 minutes (50MB cache limit, automatic cleanup)
- **Video Caching**: Videos cached for 30 minutes (100MB cache limit) - major performance boost
- **HTTP Range Support**: Video streaming with partial content (206 responses) for instant playback
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents multiple simultaneous requests for same asset
- **HTTP Cache Headers**: Browser caching (10min thumbnails, 1hr videos) with ETags
- **Frontend Optimizations**: Lazy loading images, preload="metadata" for videos, smart adjacent video preloading
- **Final Performance**: 
  - Thumbnails: 450ms → 36ms (93% faster)
  - Video Range (cached): 3-4s → 4.8ms (99.8% faster)
  - Full Video (cached): 3-4s → 173ms (95% faster)
